## Deployment guide

First, you need to install all dependencies.
At your project root directory, tape in your terminal :

```sh
npm i --save
```

Then, rename the `env.json.example` file to `env.json`

```sh
mv env.json.example env.json
```

Right, now you can run the server ...


```sh
node app.js
```

That's it !
